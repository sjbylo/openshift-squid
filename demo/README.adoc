# Demo

This `Deployment` setups a squid proxy server that requires user authentication and ACL with whitelists.

The user password is the same as the username, and are created with `htpasswd` with MD5.

[source, bash]
----
$ oc new-project squid
$ oc create -f squid.yaml
----

You can test within a pod:
[source, bash]
----
$ env http_proxy=http://user1:user1@squid.squid.svc:3128 curl -vs http://google.com > /dev/null
